FM-NavigationFramework
===========
Wouldn't it be nice to have a button bar that you could have on every layout that handles basic navigation of your FileMaker layouts? And by simply rearranging/renaming or adding layouts, your navigation would reflect the changes automatically? 

There have been other solutions over time, although not all have met all requirements that I would want of such a tool. Those would include, in no particular order: 

 • Work in Browse and Find mode. 
 • Use Themes and Styles to modify appearance.
 • Allow manually switching layouts and stay up to date. 
 • Will work with multiple windows.
 • No require any plugins. 
 • No additional schema needed. 
 • Handles an arbitrarily large enough number of layouts. 
 • Uses all native FileMaker objects and functionality. 

Other nice to haves: 

 No custom functions, for portability. 
 Retain the last visited sub-section, for navigating multiple tiers. 

This solution provides all these points and is easy to use in your own FileMaker solutions. Works with FileMaker 14 and up.
