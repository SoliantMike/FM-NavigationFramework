FM-NavigationFramework
===========
Wouldn't it be nice to have a button bar that you could have on every layout that handles basic navigation of your FileMaker layouts? And by simply rearranging/renaming or adding layouts, your navigation would reflect the changes automatically? 

There have been other solutions over time, although not all have met all requirements that I would want of such a tool. Those would include, in no particular order: 

 Work in Browse and Find mode. 
 Allow manually switching layouts and stay up to date. 
 No require any plugins. 
 No additional schema needed. 
 Work safely in multiple windows. 
 Handles an arbitrarily large enough number of layouts. 
 Uses all native FileMaker objects and functionality. 

Other nice to haves: 

 No custom functions, for portability. 
 Retain the last visited sub-section, for navigating multiple tiers. 

This solution provides all these points and is easy to use in your own FileMaker solutions. Works with FileMaker 14 and up.
